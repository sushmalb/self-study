Encapsulation means  hiding things, by making them private or inaccessible
why ?
    To make the interface simpler
    To protect the integrity of the data
    To decouple the internal details of the class

Encapsulation Principles :
==========================
To create an encapsulated class, you want to:
    Create constructors for object initialization, which enforces that only objects with valid
data will get created.
    Use the private access modifier for your fields.
    Use setter and getter methods sparingly, and only as needed.
    Use access modifiers that aren't private, only for the methods that the calling code needs
to use.
