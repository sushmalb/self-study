POJO - Plain old Java Object
has only instance fields
Used to house data and pass data between functional classes
many databases use this
It usually has few methods other than getters / setters
Also calles bean / javabean / Entities
DTO - Data Transfer Object

POJO cannot extend another class ie it cannot be a child class
Cannot implement any interfaces
No outside annotations eg:override
Simple class with no extra stuff


Overridden Method
==================
special method in java , that other classes can implement, if they use a specified method signature.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RECORDS
=========
was introduced in JDK 16
purpose is to remove boilerplate code of POJO but to be more restrictive
Java calls them "plain data carriers"
Its a special class that contains data thats not meant be altered(immutable).
Contains the fundamental methods like constructor and getters (does not have setters).
syntax
-------
public record SudentRecord() {

}

record header
==============
public record StudentRecord(String id, String name, String dob, String classList) {
                            ----------------------------------------------------
}
consists of record components , a comma delimited list of components
Afield with the same type as the record component
The field is declared private and final
it generates an accessor method(like getter but no get  prefix)
eg: not getid but just id
The members in a record are static
