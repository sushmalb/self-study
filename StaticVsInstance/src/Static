static variables do not need an instance.
can be directly called with the class name.
Share the einstances and hence all will be updated with the last instance

Instance Variables
===================
They dont use the static keyword
belong to a specific instance of a class
Each instance has a copy
represents a state of every instance of a class

Static Methods
===============
declared using static
cant access instance methods/variables directly
Usually used for ops that dont require any data from an instance(from this)
cant use "this" keyword in this method

Instance Methods
================
belongs to an instance of an class
need to instantiate class first using "new " keyword
can access instance methods/variables directly
can access static methods/variable directly

should you use static or instance?
===================================
does it use fields ? if yes instance , if not static
