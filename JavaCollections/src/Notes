Collections is an object that represents a group of objects.
Collection objects include arrays, lists, sets, queues , tables ,dictionaries and maps
All collection objects implement the collection interface , with the exception of maps.

The collection interface is at the heart of the collection hierarchy.Its the abstract representation of
the behaviour you would need, for managing a group of objects.

List :
=======
List is an ordered collection
eg: ArrayList, Linklist

Queue
======
designed for holding elements prior to processing. ie processing order matters.
eg: Queue(FIFO) and Stack(LIFO) Deque( Supports both)

Set
====
Contains no duplicate element. It is ordered collection
eg: HashSet TreeSet and LinkedHashSet

Map
====
Collection that stores key value pair.
Keys are a set , values are a separate collection.
Key keeps reference to the value.
Keys need to be unique whereas values need not be.

Polymorphic algorithm
=======================
piece if reusable functionality
