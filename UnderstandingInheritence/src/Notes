Inheritence
============
Form of code reuse
Organize classes in a  parent child hierarchy.
Child inherits fields and methods from parent.
A child can have one parent class but can inherit from parents parent and so on.
"extends" keyword specifies the superclass we want to extend
A class can only inherit one superclass.
Multiple inheritence isnt allowed
Super() is used to call a constructor of a parent class, directly from the sub class constructor.
It has to be the first statement of the constructor
this() and super() cannot be called from the same constructor.


Method Overriding
=================
Overriding a method is when you create a method on a subclass, which has the same signature as a
method on a super class.
    it can implement a completely different behavior
    it can call parent class method (default behavior)
    call parent class method and include other code

java.lang.objects
==================
    By default every class extends a special java class called Object (in the java.lang.package).
    Every class has Object as a superclass.All objects, including arrays , implement methods of this array.

Difference between this and super
=================================
super - used to call the parents class members.Commonly used with method overriding.

this - used to call the current class members.Required when we have the parameter with the same name as an
instance variable

this() - used to call a constructor from another overloaded constructor in the same class.needs to be the first
statement in the constructor.Used in constructor chaining.

super() - also needs to be first statement.
A constructor can have one of these and not both

Difference between method overriding and method overloading
===========================================================
Method overloading means providing two or more separate methods , in a class, with the same name , but
different parameters.Reduces duplicated code. we can overload static or instance methods.
Also called compile-time polymorphism. methods can also be overloaded with sub class.Return type neend not be
same.

Method overriding means defining a method in a child class, that already exists in the parent class, with the
same signature. Also called runtime polymorphism . Recommended to put @override. Cant override static methods.
Return type should match.Cant have lower access modifier. Only happens in child classes.Constructors and private
methods cant be overridden.final also cannot be overridden
